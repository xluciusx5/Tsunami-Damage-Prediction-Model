Tsunami Damage Prediction Model ðŸŒŠ

Predicting damage of a tsunami depending on its characteristics.
This project required me to formulate, research and present a mathematical and probabilistic model of attributes relating to a computer simulation with a team of 4 (me included) people.

In this team project, I had to choose, research and define a set of random variables representing a problem feature within a computer-based simulation of a real-life system or phenomenon. The simulation can be a direct computer model of the real-world system or be intended as a simulation component within a game;

For each random variable, we had to construct an appropriate probabilistic model of the distribution of values that the variable can take and to implement a means in R of randomly generating values for each variable;

This team project has enabled me to work on several skills, including:
Coordinating and leading group sessions to coordinate advancement.
Formulating a probabilistic model illustrated by random samples that accurately match the corresponding model.
Research and define each attribute of the model rigorously and combined them in a coherent manner.
Utilizing ggPlot2 for visualizing data
Utilizing the team management Agile framework including:
A Sprint Planning meeting at the start of each team session
One or more Scrum meetings throughout the sessions to communicate progress and coordinate activity
A Sprint Review meeting at the end of the session before each member leaves
